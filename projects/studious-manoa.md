<h3>Overview</h3>
Studious Manoa is a webapplication developed as a school project. The purpose of the webpage is to make it easier for students at UH Manoa to find a place to study more effectively. 

Students often go to the same places to study and aren´t aware of all the possible places to study. This webapplication allows the students to find all the different study spots and also to see which ones that are available on campus.

The appication offer to filter the studyspots after your preferences. It is also possible to rate and post comments about the different study spots. This will make the students more aware of how the different study spots are and for example if it´s full.
